## 📚 Overview

This project presents a mental health analysis of university students using Tableau. It focuses on identifying patterns of stress, anxiety, and depression among different demographic groups such as gender, academic year, and age. The goal is to support universities in understanding student well-being and to inform targeted wellness strategies.

Interactive dashboards were created to allow users to filter data, view key performance indicators, and explore trends across various student segments. Root cause analysis was also conducted to help institutions pinpoint the underlying reasons for mental health challenges in high-risk groups.
